#Open Core Notebooks

##About
This repo is a starting point for collecting notebooks (mostly iPython(Jupyter) and R) for using Open Core Data services.

At this time the notebooks are mostly just place holders and will be very verbose.  As patterns emerge elements of these notebooks will appear in libraries that will be available in this repo as well.  These libraries will enable quick access to data in the Open Core Data services. 

The first notebook is just to get things started and begin to build from it in the open.

Anyone who wishes to get involved and develop notebooks is welcome.  Please contact me and I will be happy to help.  A key element to this will be when the services in ocdServices are marked up with swagger doc landing pages.
